Basic user information input form

Practice with JavaScript animations, CSS input form types, and more basic design. Allows a user to enter various information as prompted. Checks to ensure that the information that was submitted matches the type that was requested, ie. emails must be of the form xyz@blah.com or else they will not be accepted.
